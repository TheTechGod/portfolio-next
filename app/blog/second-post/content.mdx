# Next.js + Bootstrap for a clean developer portfolio

For my developer portfolio, I wanted speed and structure:
- Next.js App Router (TypeScript)
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
- Sass for easy overrides

I wired up:
- A navbar + footer on all pages
- Project pages with case studies
- A contact form API route
- Blog powered by MDX

Lighthouse scores hit **90+** for accessibility and performance ðŸš€
